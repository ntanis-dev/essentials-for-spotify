## Notes

I started this project in plain JavaScript, then halfway through rewrote the buttons and dials in TypeScript.\
However I never had the grit to port the rest, so now it‚Äôs a hybrid mess, sorry about that. üòÅ\
I only built it because when I got my first Stream Deck, every available Spotify control plugin fell short for my taste.
